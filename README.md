# Agentic-Semiconductor-Quantum-Device-Fabrication
Tuning quantum dot devices requires iterative scans, expert heuristics, and manual ML coordination, making it slow, fragile, and hard to scale. This AI agent autonomously selects measurements, integrates ML tools, enforces safety, detects anomalies, and logs decisions to boost yield and reproducibility.

# =============================================================================
# 🚀 QUICK START FOR JUDGES
# =============================================================================
# This notebook is pre-configured to work immediately.
# 
# RECOMMENDED: Just run Section 27 - COMPLETE WORKFLOW
#   • Validates safety systems
#   • Runs agent demo with physics simulator
#   • Compares vs baselines
#   • Generates final report
#
# To run everything:
#   1. Runtime → Run all
#   2. Wait ~5-10 minutes
#   3. Check final report: /content/agentic_qdots_day4/docs/day4_FINAL_REPORT.md
#
# OPTIONAL: watsonx.ai integration
#   • Agent works WITHOUT Granite (uses heuristic policy)
#   • To enable Granite: Add secrets 'IBMCLOUD' and 'qdots-agent-project-ID'
#   • Get API key: https://cloud.ibm.com/iam/apikeys
