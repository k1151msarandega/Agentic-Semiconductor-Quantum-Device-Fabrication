# Agentic-Semiconductor-Quantum-Device-Fabrication
Tuning quantum dot devices requires iterative scans, expert heuristics, and manual ML coordination, making it slow, fragile, and hard to scale. This AI agent autonomously selects measurements, integrates ML tools, enforces safety, detects anomalies, and logs decisions to boost yield and reproducibility.
